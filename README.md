# Ï„ Twilio Webhook

Tao server is the central texting webhook for Creative Solutions Group

It aims to be a small codebase with a very simplistic API, exposing only what is needed.

It is written in Golang. Please follow online guides to get set up, and then clone this repository.

## Why Lambda?

Lambda is very cheap, and allows us to expose only what we need without an underlying server.

## Development

There is no local testing, unless you feel like diving deep into the AWS ecosystem.
